## Description

This is a text-based zombie fighting game where you are head to head with a zombie and must fight for dear life.  You are given the option to select a number from 1 to 5 in order to see whether you are able to hit the zombie.  If the zombie rolls the same as you, you succeeded!  Otherwise, the zombie will do damage to you.  Keep rolling until one of you are out of health.  To the victor goes the spoils.

This game was developed using node.js JavaScript language as well as the inquirer node module to acquire user inputs.
